The dataset which we will be working on is taken from Kaggle,which contains e-commerce transactions made during an year.
This is a transnational data set for a UK-based and registered non-store online retail which mainly sells unique all-occasion gifts. Many customers of the company are wholesalers.
Dataset consists of 8 columns(Invoice.No,Stock code,Description,Quantity,Invoice date,Unit price,Customer ID,Country) with 542K rows.

Customer segmentation refers to the process of dividing a broad consumer business market, normally consisting of existing and potential customers, into sub-groups of consumers based on some type of shared characteristics. In this project we implement it using an online retail database which contains transactions made by customers on an e-commerce website during a period of one year and classify a customer based on region and some other attributes.Using RFM(recency,frequency,monetary) technique we identify the best customers.This gives us a strong position to gain and retain the customers with the help of an efficient marketing team which can push the right offers to corresponding customers.
